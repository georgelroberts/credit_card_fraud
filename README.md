# Credit card fraud detection
Anomaly detection problem found on kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud). Scrambled features are used, alongside the amount of each transaction, for this highly imbalanced dataset.
In this project I will take a broad look at the data, doing some EDA, then fit a model to the data (likely LightGBM or XGBoost) and take a look at the results

### Prerequisites

Code is run using python3.7. 
Pip requirements can be found in requirements.txt
